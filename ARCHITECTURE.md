# ARCHITECTURE

A map of the `frost` crate for getting up to speed quickly: what each file is for,
how a frame flows through the library, and the invariants the code relies on.
The doc comments in the source are the ground truth — this file is the index and
the "why".

## What frost is

A **minimal winit + wgpu immediate-mode drawing library** for games in Rust
(edition 2024). You give it a `Scene` (a tree of nodes) and a `Process` (a
per-frame callback), and it runs an event loop: each frame your `Process` mutates
the scene and issues immediate draws, then the scene tree is updated and drawn.

Design stance (see `README.md`): a game-engine experiment by N65 Game Research
Station. Deliberately **not** Bevy-style ECS with shared mutability — plain Rust
ownership, a scene tree, and immediate drawing. Goals: a realistic reasoning
challenge for a local-hosted AI workflow, human learning of engine internals, and
(if it works) the core mechanics of a library-based engine.

                      read and baked once, the load refused loudly on any

```

The library uses only the `log` facade; consumers wire up their own logger
(`env_logger` in the examples). No randomness crate either: `frost::Rng`
(`src/rng.rs`) is a splitmix64 — pure 64-bit arithmetic, identical on every
target; `Rng::new()` seeds from the clock, `Rng::with_seed(seed)` fixes the
stream for reproducible runs and tests, and `state()` / `set_state()` let a
save file carry the stream across (`immortal` does exactly that).

## The public API (src/lib.rs)

- `frost::run(scene: Scene, process: P) -> Result<(), ...>` — the entry point.
  `run_configured` takes a `Config { vsync: bool, window_size: Option<[u32;2]>,
  window_size_px: Option<[u32;2]> }` (vsync default on, window size default
  platform) to turn vsync off for uncapped frame rates or open the window at
  a specific inner size — `window_size` in logical pixels, `window_size_px`
  in **physical** pixels and winning over it. The engine's user space is
  physical, so `window_size_px` pins an identical design space on every
  display whatever scaling the OS applies (this is why `immortal`,
  `dogs_name` and `centipede` open at a true 1920×1080 on all four dev
  machines); it is ignored on web, where CSS sizes the canvas. The user can
  still resize afterwards. Both functions exist for native and wasm32.
- `Process` — `fn process(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context, dt: f32)`; `dt` is
  seconds since the previous frame (`0.0` on the first, clamped to 1.0s).
  **Any `FnMut(&mut Context, f32)` closure is a `Process`.**
- `Context` — derefs to the frame's `Canvas` (immediate draws), and:
  - `scene() -> &mut Scene` — mutable access to the scene passed to `run`;
    mutate it here to animate it; it is drawn after the process returns.
  - `key_down(KeyCode) -> bool` — held physical keys (scancodes, layout-free).
  - `char_down(char) -> bool` — whether a held key typed that character when
    it went down, under the user's keyboard layout: the layout-following
    twin of `key_down` (a physical code names a US-ANSI position — the
    Swedish `+` key reports the code US calls `Minus`; `char_down('+')`
    finds the `+` key on any layout). The character carries the modifiers
    held at press (a macOS Option rewrites them); a release removes by
    physical code, so held state never sticks.
  - `mouse_position() -> Option<[f32;2]>` — user coords, `None` when the cursor
    is outside the window (last known position is deliberately dropped).
  - `mouse_button_down(MouseButton) -> bool`
  - `mouse_wheel() -> f32` — vertical wheel movement since the previous
    frame, in lines (positive = up). It sums every wheel event of the frame
    (`LineDelta` as-is, `PixelDelta` at 120 px/line) and is reset after the
    frame's `process`, so an unread frame discards its delta.
  - `window() -> Option<&Window>` — the engine's winit `Window` (`None` only
    before the first frame exists): parent native dialogs to it (e.g.
    `rfd::FileDialog::set_parent`, as `sprite_util` does) and read any window
    state the platform exposes — `inner_size()` / `scale_factor()` for
    pixel-exact math (the `worm` example wraps at the window's *physical*
    edges converted through the scale factor).
  - `gamepads() -> impl Iterator<Item = Gamepad>` — the connected
    controllers (gilrs): each reports its pressed buttons and axis values,
    updated with the frame's events; empty when none is connected or the
    platform's input devices could not be opened at startup. `Axis`,
    `Button`, and `Gamepad` are re-exported from gilrs.
  - `expected_fps() -> Option<f32>` — monitor refresh rate when vsync is on.
  - `frame_processing_ms() -> f64` — the engine's CPU time for the last
    completed frame (its own probe; see "Diagnostics" below).
  - `frame_draw_calls() -> u32` — the engine's GPU draw calls for the last
    completed frame (its own probe; see "Diagnostics" below).
  - `frame_diagnostic_draw_calls() -> u32` — the subset of those spent on
    the `Diagnostics` overlay's own nodes (its own probe; see "Diagnostics"
    below).
  - `size() -> (f32, f32)` — window size in pixels.
- Re-exports: `KeyCode`, `MouseButton`, `Axis`/`Button`/`Gamepad` (gilrs),
  `Rng`, `Tween`/`Repeat`, `ParticleSystem`/`Particle`, `Ui`/`UiStyle`, and
  everything from `objects` (`Scene`, `SceneNode`, `Node`, `Shape`, `Light`,
  `Color`, `Transform`, `Layer`, `Canvas`).
- Native only (no wasm32): `Audio`, `Sound`, `AudioError` (see
  "Audio (native only)" below).

**Coordinate system.** User space is in **pixels**, origin at the **window
center**, **y pointing up**: top-left = `(-w/2, h/2)`. The canvas works in
physical pixels internally; the only conversion is the cursor flip done when
building the `Context` (physical y-down → user y-up).

### Frame flow (the whole library in one pass)

`Frost::render()` (src/backend/app.rs) is the heart:

1. Acquire the surface texture (`Timeout` → log and skip the frame).
2. Build a fresh `Canvas` for the pixel size; compute `dt` from a monotonic
   millisecond clock (`Instant` native, `performance.now()` wasm), clamped to
   1.0s.
3. Build the `Context` (canvas + scene + held keys + typed characters +
   mouse state) and call `process.process(&mut ctx, dt)`.
4. `scene.visit()` — every node's `Node::process`, **children before parent**
   (post-order), on the root tree and every layer tree.
5. `canvas.draw_scene(&scene)` — walks each group depth-first, composing
   transforms/modulates/orders, and records `Draw`s (see below).
6. `canvas.expand_text(&mut text_atlases)` — lays out every `Draw::Text` and
   splices one `Draw::Sprite` per glyph **in place**, so glyphs keep their
   node's position in the paint order.
7. `canvas.paint_order()` — merges groups (base group first by implicit order
   0.0, layers by `Layer::order`, higher on top; stable) and **stable-sorts
   each group by `z`** (lower first; ties keep call order, so the last drawn is
   on top).
8. One render pass for the whole frame: clear with the frame's background color,
   then per draw: set the scissor to the draw's **tight bounding box**, build a
   fresh uniform buffer + bind group, draw a full-screen triangle.
9. `queue.submit`, `queue.present`. `RedrawRequested` re-requests the next
   frame, so animation runs continuously.

## The scene graph (src/objects.rs)

- `Scene { root: SceneNode, layers: Vec<Layer>, camera: Option<NodePath>,
  ambient: Color }` — `ambient` is the light floor every lit receiver adds
  under itself (a dim neutral gray by default; see "Lighting" below).
  `Scene::visit()` updates the root subtree and every layer subtree.
- `SceneNode` — a `transform` + `scale` + `modulate` + `order`, an optional
  `shape`, and `children`. All four are **relative to the parent**. Three
  per-node lighting flags (`lit`, `occludes`, `glow`) join them; unlike these
  four they apply to the node's own shape only and never propagate (see
  "Lighting" below):
  - transform/scale: `local = scale(node.scale).compose(&node.transform)`,
    `world = local.compose(&parent)`. **Scale is innermost** — it applies to the
    node's own shape *and* composes onto descendants.
  - `modulate` multiplies channel-wise into the node's shape color and composes
    onto descendants' (a descendant's color is the product of modulates on its
    root-to-leaf path). `Color` fields are 0..=1; `WHITE` is the identity.
  - `order` adds to the subtree's draw `z` (inherited `order + node.order`).
  - A node without a shape is a pure group/pivot; `..SceneNode::default()`
    fills identity transform, no scale, white modulate, order 0.
- `Node` trait — `visit()` (post-order walk) and `process()` (default no-op),
  so custom node types can participate; `SceneNode` implements it.
- `Layer { order, speed, root }` — a **hard draw partition** painted as a whole
  at `order` (its internal `z` ordering only matters inside the layer), with a
  parallax `speed` under a camera. `Layer::repeat` tiles the layer's content
  with a period ≥ the window size, splitting boundary-crossing objects into
  wrapping slices (drawing the same object twice aborts with an error).
- `camera: Option<NodePath>` — when set, every group is drawn from the camera
  node's coordinate space: the scene is transformed by the **inverse of the
  camera's world transform**, with the translation scaled per group (base 1.0,
  each layer by its `speed`) — that's the parallax: higher speed reads as
  closer. `NodePath` names a node by (group index?, child indices).
  `Scene::world_at(path)` / `Scene::camera_world()` compute the composed world
  transform (`pub(crate)` `world_at` / `camera_world` in `src/objects.rs`).
- `Transform` — `p' = m * p + t` with rows `m[0]`, `m[1]`; `rotate(angle)` is
  CCW from +x toward +y; `a.compose(&b)` means **a first, then b**
  (matrix `b.m * a.m`); `invert()` for the render path; `scales()` for the AA
  band.
- `Shape` (attached to a node, drawn in the node's local space before its
  children, so parents paint under descendants):
  - `Circle { center, radius, color }`, `Rectangle { center, extent (half
    widths), color }` — the node's world transform applies.
  - `Polyline { points, width, color }` — straight segments through the
    points (local space), stroked at `width`, one draw call for the whole
    chain (max 128 points; fewer than two draws nothing). Width scales with
    the node's geometric-mean scale axis.
  - `Particles { system, color, shape: ParticleShape }` — an instanced
    particle batch (one draw per batch; the game updates `system` each
    frame). `ParticleShape` picks the primitive each instance draws:
    `Circle` (radius = the particle's size), `Rectangle { aspect }`
    (`size × 2` wide, `size × aspect × 2` tall), or a sprite. Each
    `Particle` carries its own `angle`, so instances rotate individually —
    spinning squares just advance it (see
    `examples/particles/square_fountains.rs`).
  - `Background { color }` — fills the window, **ignores all transforms**,
    drawn at the very back: at render time it becomes the frame's clear color
    (the last one in depth-first call order wins; default is a dark blue-gray
    when none exists). It costs no draw call.
  - `Sprite { data, width, height, color, alpha, filter }` — RGBA8 PNG from
    `Shape::sprite(path)` / `sprite_bytes(bytes)` / `sprite_nearest` /
    `sprite_bytes_nearest` (decoded eagerly; `SpriteError` on failure).
    `filter: SpriteFilter::{Linear, Nearest}` picks the GPU sampler —
    Nearest keeps pixel art crisp when scaled.
    Centered on the node origin, 1 texture pixel per scene pixel. `color` tints
    every pixel (white = unchanged); overall opacity = texture alpha × `alpha`
    × `color.a`.
  - `Light { light: Light }` — contributes the node's [`Light`] to the
    frame's light field; never drawn itself (see "Lighting" below).
  - `Text { text, font: Arc<[u8]>, size, weight, color, alpha }` — from
    `Shape::text`/`text_bytes` (swash, CPU-only), thickened with
    `Shape::with_weight` (the `wght` variation axis; 400 Regular, 700 bold —
    inert on static fonts). Centered on the node origin;
    each glyph becomes a tinted quad over a shared atlas.
  - Color model: plain shapes emit `coverage * a`; sprites/text emit
    `texture_alpha * opacity * a` — all composited with `ALPHA_BLENDING`.

## Lighting (src/objects.rs + the backend)

A per-pixel light field, evaluated inside the *existing* shape/sprite/particle
pipelines — no extra pass, pipeline, or draw call, and skipped light draws
never count (`Diagnostics` excludes them like backgrounds).

- A `Shape::Light` node contributes a `Light { color, intensity, radius,
  direction, spread, softness, penumbra }` at the node's local origin: the
  node's transform (and ancestors') places it, rotates its beam, and tints it
  through the composed modulate. Three kinds: **omni** (`spread ≥ TAU`, the
  default — lights every pixel within `radius`, fading to zero at the edge),
  **cone** (narrower `spread` around `direction`, edges feathered by
  `softness` — a torch), and **directional** (`Light::directional`, marked by
  a negative `radius` sentinel: parallel rays, no falloff, position ignored —
  a sun; a scene may carry any number). `penumbra` is the light disk's radius:
  shadow rays sample it (nine taps, rotated per pixel), so shadows fade
  across an edge instead of dropping hard.
- Receivers opt in per node, flag applies to that shape only:
  `SceneNode::lit` multiplies the shape's color by `ambient + Σ lights +
  glow` per pixel; `SceneNode::glow` (a `Color`, alpha-scaled) is the shape's
  own emission — visible in the dark, never shadowed, never spilling onto
  neighbors (attach a `Shape::Light` child for that); `SceneNode::occludes`
  makes a shape's transformed silhouette block every light's path to pixels
  behind it — a shadow caster. A wall can be `lit + occludes` at once. A
  painted rectangle reaches the field as itself and a painted circle as the
  sixteen-gon inscribed in it, because a curve still has to be told to
  hardware as flat edges; `Shape::Sprite` has no silhouette to pack at all, so
  anything else that must cast, a sprite body, one tile of a map, a physics hit
  box, declares itself with
  `Canvas::occluder(world, center, half)`: a box in its own space plus a world
  transform, joining the same field after the painted occluders. Both channels
  keep the shape local, which is why a non-uniformly scaled caster still throws
  square-cornered shadows — the shader pulls the pixel into the shape's space
  rather than pushing a sheared box out. A shape that is neither a rectangle nor
  aligned in its own space declares with `Canvas::occluder_polygon(world,
  &Convex)` instead, and a *disc* occludes that way too: a curved edge has to be
  told to hardware as flat ones, so a disc ships the sixteen-gon inscribed in it
  (its corners on the circle, within two percent of its radius) while physics
  keeps the round `Circle` and its exact normal.
- The backend packs the frame into two **storage buffers** bound to every
  draw: the light field (32-byte header — count and the scene's ambient —
  plus one 48-byte record per light) and the occluder field (16-byte header
  plus a 48-byte record per occluder, each followed by one 16-byte half-plane
  per edge of a polygon). Both start at their binding minimum and grow
  only to the peak count, so a lighter frame writes a shorter slice into the
  same buffer; the shaders read ambient and the lists from these fields.

## The draw list (src/backend/frame.rs)

`Canvas` holds `draws` (the **base group**: immediate methods + every scene's
root subtree, mixed) plus one list per explicit layer (`layer_draws`,
`layer_orders`).

- Immediate methods: `line`, `circle`, `rectangle` (pixel args converted to
  pixel space via `user_to_pixels`), `text` (records a `Draw::Text` with a
  translate-only user-space transform, expanded by `expand_text` like a
  node's text), and `draw_scene`.
- `Draw` enum: `Line`, `Polyline` (the batched line: `points: Vec<[f32; 2]>`
  in pixel space, `width`, `color` — consecutive pairs joined by straight
  segments, stroked by one full-screen-triangle draw against a fixed
  128-point uniform array — the points are packed as vec4s (x, y, 0, 0)
  because the uniform address space requires an array stride that is a
  multiple of 16 bytes; fewer than two points draws nothing, more than 128
  draw the first 128), `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Shape` (transformed SDF
  circle/rectangle: `world`, `center`, `params` (circle `[r,0]`, rect `[hx,hy]`),
  `kind` 0/1, `aa`, `color`), `Sprite` (`world`, `data: Arc<[u8]>`, `size`,
  `texture_size`, `aa`, `tint`, `alpha`, `uv_rect`, `z`), `Text` (expanded
  before rendering — never reaches the render loop), `Background` (becomes the
  clear color — never drawn).
- **Scissoring**: every draw's fragment work is clipped to its tight pixel
  bounding box (`scissor_rect`, including the AA band), so **GPU cost scales
  with on-screen object area, not window size**. Rotated shapes/sprites get the
  AABB of their four transformed corners (`aabb_of_box`).
- **Anti-aliasing**: `AA_BAND = 0.75` px on the CPU; the same constant appears
  as `aa` in the shader sources — keep them in sync. Under node scaling the
  band is divided by the transform's scale so it stays a constant screen width.
- **Uniform writers** (`line_uniform_data`, `polyline_uniform_data`,
  `circle_uniform_data`, `rect_uniform_data`, `shape_uniform_data`,
  `sprite_uniform_data`) hand-write
  little-endian bytes at explicit offsets matching the WGSL **uniform-space**
  layout (e.g. ShapeUniforms: `to_local` mat2x2 @0 (16B, 8-aligned columns),
  `translation` @16, `center` @24, `params` @32, `color` vec4 @48, `misc` @64;
  total 80. Sprite the same with `size`/tint/`alpha`/`uv_rect`). Line/circle
  are 48 bytes, rectangle 32. The polyline writer packs 2080 bytes:
  `points` @0 (128 × vec4 — 2048 bytes), `color` @2048, `count` @2064 (u32),
  `width` @2068.

## The GPU side (src/backend/app.rs, shaders/)

- `Frost<P>` holds the wgpu instance/adapter/device/queue, `vsync`,
  `window_size` and `window_size_px` (the `Config` values), the window
  (`Arc<Window>`), logical
  size + scale factor, the surface, the seven pipelines
  (line/polyline/circle/rect/shape/sprite/particles), `sprite_resources` (a
  `HashMap<(u64, u64), (TextureView, Sampler)>` keyed by the sprite pixel-data
  `Arc`'s pointer plus its generation — `0` for static images, bumped by the
  glyph atlas on every repack — so a freed-and-recycled buffer address can
  never hit a stale texture; sprites from the same file, and glyph quads from
  the same atlas, **share one uploaded texture**), `text_atlases`
  (`HashMap<(font ptr, size bits), text::Atlas>`, kept between frames so
  unchanged text never re-rasterizes), held keys/mouse, and the user's
  `process` + `scene`.
- All seven pipelines are the same shape: a **full-screen triangle** vertex
  shader (no vertex buffer), one `@binding(0)` uniform (plus texture + sampler
  for sprites, plus an instance buffer for particles), alpha blending, no
  depth. `present_mode_for(vsync)` maps to `AutoVsync`/`AutoNoVsync`.
- **One fresh uniform buffer per draw call** — required because
  `queue.write_buffer` copies are flushed as a batch *before any draw
  executes*, so a shared buffer would make every draw read the last parameters.
- Sprite textures are `Rgba8UnormSrgb` (samples land in linear space; sRGB
  blending matches authored colors), linear-filtered, clamp-to-edge.
- The shape/sprite shaders evaluate an **SDF in the object's local space**: the
  fragment's pixel coordinate is transformed by the inverse world transform
  (uploaded as `to_local` + `translation`; a non-invertible transform is
  skipped), the signed distance is measured in local units, and
  `smoothstep(-aa, aa, d)` gives the coverage. Rotation and scaling "apply for
  free".
- Events (native): keyboard held-set and per-key typed characters (Escape
  exits), cursor position, mouse
  buttons, mouse wheel (accumulated in lines per frame, reset after the
  frame's `process`), `CursorLeft`/`Focused(false)` **clear** the held state
  and the typed characters (no stuck controls), resize/scale-factor
  reconfigure the surface (pipelines
  rebuild only if the format changed), `RedrawRequested` → `render()` +
  re-request.
  The window opens at the `Config`'s `window_size_px`/`window_size` (or the
  platform default),
  centered on the monitor, and requests its first redraw explicitly (Wayland
  won't deliver one otherwise).
- `block_on` (native only) drives the adapter/device futures with a no-op
  waker — the browser can't block on them, hence `WebFrost`.

### wasm32 (src/backend/wasm.rs)

In the browser `request_adapter`/`request_device` are JS promises that only
resolve once the main thread is free, so `run` defers GPU setup: `WebFrost`
creates the canvas immediately (`Config::window_size` in CSS pixels, 900×600
default — `window_size_px` is native-only), appended to the page), keeps the
scene/process in a `Core`, and on every `resumed` polls the in-flight setup
future (`GpuInit::{Idle, Init, Failed}`); when it completes it hands everything
to a real `Frost`. `hide_fallback`/`show_fallback` swap the page's "Loading
frost…" placeholder with the first frame or a red error message.

## Text (src/text.rs)

CPU-only, built on **swash** (pure-Rust Fontation shaping/rasterization):

- `layout(font: &[u8], text, size, weight) -> Option<TextLayout>` shapes the string into
  `PlacedGlyph { id, x, y }` (pen origin at baseline left, y up) and returns
  metrics `{ ascent, descent, width, glyphs }`.
- Each unique glyph is rasterized **once per (font, size, weight)** into a shared 512px
  shelf atlas (`ATLAS_SIZE: u32 = 512`) — first-fit row packing; oversize
  glyphs are skipped but the cursor still advances. Output is RGBA8 with alpha
  replicated across channels.
- `Canvas::expand_text` (src/lib.rs) consumes the `Draw::Text` entries, lays
  them out, and replaces each with per-glyph `Draw::Sprite`s sampling the
  atlas sub-rectangle (`uv_rect`) — this is why sprite `uv_rect` exists.

## Tween (src/tween.rs)

`Tween<T: Tweenable>` for `f32` and `[f32;2]`: `new(from, to, duration)`
(default `Repeat::PingPong`), `repeat(Repeat::{Once, Loop, PingPong})`,
`tick(dt) -> T`. Durations are floored at 1e-6. **There is no re-target API** —
the established pattern (e.g. `examples/inout/cursor.rs`) is to **rebuild the
tween**
on the press/release edge with the current value as the new `from`.

## Particles (src/particles.rs)

`Particle { pos, vel, life, max_life, size, angle }`; `ParticleSystem { particles: Vec }`
with `spawn(p)` and `update(dt, gravity)` — semi-implicit Euler
(`vel += g*dt`, then `pos += vel*dt`), `life -= dt`, `retain(|p| p.life > 0.0)`.
Pure simulation, renderer-independent; **drawing is the caller's job**
(typically `ctx.circle` per particle, alpha ∝ remaining life). Emission is
accumulated in the caller (`acc += rate*dt; while acc >= 1.0 { acc -= 1.0; spawn }`)
so the spawn rate is independent of frame rate.

## Collision (src/collision.rs)

Pure math — no winit/wgpu, identical on wasm, no dependencies. Intentionally
**minimal by design**; the documented escape hatch when the game outgrows it is
`rapier2d` (the scene bridge and rendering would stay the same):

- `OrientedBox { center, half, angle }` (full size = 2×half, CCW angle) with
  `axis(i)` and `corners()` (CCW from lower-left); `Circle { center, radius }`;
  `Collider::{Box, Circle}`.
- `push_out(&other) -> Option<PushOut { dir, depth }>` — the minimum separating
  translation to resolve the overlap (SAT for boxes, direct for circles).
- Segment queries, the CPU twin of the shaders' `occluded` so gameplay and
  pixels answer the same question: `Collider::cast(from, to) -> Option<t>`
  (the entering `t` of the open segment) and `contains(p)`, plus the two
  policies over a field of shapes — `occluded(from, to, &[..])`, where a
  receiver *inside* an occluder is lit, and `visible(from, to, &[..])` for line
  of sight, where a shape holding either endpoint blocks — and `first_hit` for
  the index of the nearest. That inside-case split is the whole difference
  between the two policies.
- `reflect(vel, normal, restitution)` — kills the normal component (scaled by
  restitution), leaves the tangent; no-op for velocity already leaving the
  surface.
- The intended usage pattern: the game's `Process` owns all state, builds
  colliders from node transforms each frame, applies `push_out` + `reflect`,
  and writes the results back into the node transforms.

## Physics (src/physics.rs)

The collision module answers static questions and owns no state; physics
puts those shapes in motion. A `Body` is a `Collider` (which carries the
position, as it does for every shape) plus a velocity and a weight, and the
module's one contract is that contacts trade momentum without spending
energy.

- `Body::advance(dt)` integrates the center by the velocity — position is a
  `Collider::translate`, so the shape stays the shape.
- `resolve_pair(a, b)` stands two overlapping bodies apart along the
  `push_out` normal, splitting the penetration by inverse weight (the lighter
  does most of the moving), then reverses their approach with an equal-and-
  opposite impulse along that normal. The impulse is `e = 1` and touches only
  the normal component, so the closing speed becomes the separating speed:
  energy and momentum both hold. A pair that overlaps yet is already parting
  gets the positional fix only, never a second kick.
- `resolve_static(body, wall)` is the same with an immovable partner — it
  reduces exactly to `reflect(vel, dir, 1.0)`, so a wall takes nothing.
- `kinetic_energy` and `momentum` read the two ledgers; a test watches the
  first stay flat across a three-body round and every wall bounce.

It is deliberately small: discrete integration (a body moving farther than a
wall is thick in one frame passes through — `Collider::cast` is the tool for
that day), no angular momentum, friction, or gravity. The same
rapier2d-upgrade note from the collision section covers outgrowing it.

## Bake (src/bake.rs)

Authored geometry — a sprite's body, a tile's solid top, a hurt box — turns
into engine shapes here. Pure math like collision: no winit, no wgpu, no state,
nothing but data in and flat lists out.

- `Feature { role, shape, material }` is one authored fact, in the space of the
  sprite frame or atlas cell it describes: `Footprint::{rect, tilted, disc,
  poly}` for the shape, `Role::{Occlude, Solid, Hit}` for what it is for, and
  `Material { bounce }` — the `e` of `reflect` — for the roles that care.
- `Baker` takes a `Feature` list per `Placement` (a sprite frame at its own
  origin, one atlas cell per tile that uses it) and `finish()`es the whole set
  into `Baked`. Collecting before fusing is what lets a tile map bake at all:
  two tiles of one wall fuse because they end up adjacent in the map's space,
  which nothing knows while the cell is still one cell.
- In and out, everything stays in **the node's own space**. A baked set rides
  the node's `Transform`, one bake serves every instance, and a stretched or
  turned sprite still throws square-cornered shadows because nothing was baked
  into world coordinates and nothing has to approximate a sheared box.
- `Baked { occluders, disc_occluders, poly_occluders, solids, hits }` is one
  authored set seen per consumer,
  because the consumers want different things from the same shape. `occluders`
  are fused rectangles — the GPU reads one record per shape and tests every lit
  pixel against every record, so a floor of four thousand tiles is four thousand
  shadow tests per pixel per light, and fusing also retires the shared edge, the
  one seam a light ray can slip along. `solids` fuse too, but only within one
  material, so a crate touching a trampoline does not become one bouncing wall.
  `hits` are never fused, because the game has to answer *which box was
  struck*. `disc_occluders` are the circles authored to cast — kept circles,
  counted rather than merged, since no fusion of two circles is a circle anyone
  drew, and cut into the polygon the light field speaks only on the way out, so
  a bake never holds an approximation of a shape somebody authored.
  `poly_occluders` are the convex outlines authored to cast, and they need no
  last-moment work at all: the outline is already the edges the field speaks.
- A fusion is taken only when the result is still one rectangle covering
  exactly the points its parts covered: agree across one axis, touch or overlap
  along the other, repeated until a pass changes nothing. An L stays two boxes
  and a gap stays a gap, while a 4×5 block becomes one box. Boxes fuse only
  with others turned alike, and a turn within a hair of a quarter turn is
  snapped to it — which is what lets a tile laid down sideways, or turned three
  quarters, fuse with its upright neighbours. Away from a quarter turn "alike"
  means *the same number*: a turn reached by two different calculations costs an
  extra record and never a wrong box, because a fusion group takes one of its own
  members as its frame, and that is what makes the fusion exact rather than
  nearly so. Widening the grouping past a rounding error buys the records back
  and charges the difference to the edges.
- Nothing is dropped quietly. `add` returns `Rejection { index, role, why }`,
  `#[must_use]`, for geometry the bake cannot honour: a shape with no area, or a
  corner that is not a number. A painted sprite that silently cannot cast a
  shadow is exactly the failure this path exists to end, so it says so out loud
  instead of leaving a list that looks fine. What it *can* honour has grown: an
  occluding circle used to be a refusal, and is now the round list above.
- Two exits close the loop: `declare_occluders(canvas, world)` feeds the fused
  boxes to `Canvas::occluder` under the node's transform, each box's own turn
  folded into that transform so the shape stays local, and the round and
  polygonal lists to `Canvas::occluder_polygon` — the discs as `Convex::disc`,
  the authored outlines as drawn — the tessellation happens here,
  at the border and once, which is why nothing upstream of it is an
  approximation; and `occluder_colliders()` hands the same shapes — the discs
  still round, because asking the CPU about the polygon would fold the answer
  into the question — to `occluded` / `visible`, so the gameplay answer and the
  pixel answer come from one bake.
- Not here yet: capsules; convex polygons as `solids` or `hits`, which is a
  step of its own — they occlude already, but pushing two polygons apart needs
  the separating axis of a curved boundary and a contact normal worth the name,
  while occlusion only ever asks whether a segment crossed an edge; the reader
  that builds these features from the `.ron` sidecar which already rides
  each sprite has arrived as `src/shapes.rs`, whose vocabulary and constraints
  are written up in `docs/authored-shapes.md`; and a tile-grid broadphase for
  line queries over very large maps — fused strips keep a linear scan cheap
  enough until a real map says otherwise.

## Shaders (shaders/*.wgsl, src/shaders.rs)

Nine pipelines, all full-screen-triangle + SDF/sampling; seven are tabulated:

| file        | pipeline   | uniforms (byte layout)                                              |
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| line.wgsl   | line       | `a`@0 `b`@8 `color`@16 `width`@32 → 48                             |
| polyline.wgsl | polyline | `points`@0 (128 × vec4, 2048B) `color`@2048 `count`@2064 (u32) `width`@2068 → 2080 |
| circle.wgsl | circle     | `center`@0 `color`@16 `radius`@32 → 48                             |
| rectangle.wgsl | rectangle | `center`@0 `extent`@8 `color`@16 → 32                            |
| shape.wgsl  | shape      | `to_local`@0 `translation`@16 `center`@24 `params`@32 `color`@48 `misc`@64 → 80 |
| sprite.wgsl | sprite     | `to_local`@0 `translation`@16 `size`@24 `tint`@32 `alpha`@48 `uv_rect`@64 → 80 |
| particles.wgsl | particles | `size`@0 `color`@16 `misc`@32 `lit`@40 → 48 (one instanced draw per batch) |

`lighting.wgsl` is in no table because it is not a pipeline: it is WGSL text
`src/shaders.rs` prepends to `shape.wgsl`, `sprite.wgsl` and `particles.wgsl`,
the three pipelines that read the frame's light and occluder fields. It holds
what those three had as byte-identical copies — the two field record types, the
`occluded` slab test, the shadow taps, the `light_mix` loop — and it declares no
`@group` or `@binding`, because those two storage bindings sit at different
indices per pipeline, so each host keeps its own `field` and `occluders`
declarations around it. The shared text therefore reads two names declared after
it, which WGSL allows: a module-scope name is in scope across the whole program.
`occluded` walks the occluder records with a running offset rather than a
stride, because a polygon's record is `3 + edges` `vec4`s and a box's is still
exactly three — the count riding in a component that was padding, so a field
packed before polygons still reads as boxes. The naga tests below run on the
*assembled* sources, and
`the_lighting_vocabulary_is_shared_not_copied` keeps a copy from creeping back
into a fourth shader, where it would compile happily and disagree with the rest.

The polyline's fragment shader walks its 128-point uniform array and takes the
minimum point-to-segment distance — a stroke of any length is still one draw
call; its scissor is the point bounding box plus half the stroke width and the
AA band, so the fragment loop only runs over the pixels the stroke can write.

`src/shaders.rs` includes them and has tests that **parse all nine with
`naga::front::wgsl::parse_str`** (the same frontend wgpu uses, so validity is
pinned without a GPU) and assert the `ShapeUniforms`/`SpriteUniforms` member
offsets are `[0,16,24,32,48,64]` spanning 80 bytes, the `ParticlesUniforms`
offsets are `[0,16,32,40]` spanning 48, and the `PolylineUniforms` offsets are
`[0,2048,2064,2068]` spanning 2080 with a fixed 128-point vec4 array — the **CPU
uniform writers must mirror these layouts**; the GPU-side mirror tests live in
`src/backend/tests/`. If you change a shader uniform struct, update the
writer and both test sides together.

## Audio (native only)

`src/audio.rs` plays sounds through **rodio** on the host's default output
device. The module is `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`-gated in
`lib.rs` (rodio's cpal device layer is native-only), so wasm builds never
compile it; `Audio`/`Sound`/`AudioError` are re-exported from the root only
on native targets.

- `Sound::load(path)` / `Sound::load_bytes(bytes)` — **load-time decode**:
  the file (WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG Vorbis, AAC, M4A) is read and decoded once,
  into an in-memory `rodio::buffer::SamplesBuffer` of f32 samples, so a bad
  path or format is an `AudioError` up front, not at play time. The samples
  sit behind an `Arc`, so re-triggering a `Sound` shares one buffer and
  clones are cheap. Accessors: `channels()`, `sample_rate()`, `duration()`.
- `Audio::new()` — opens the default output device
  (`DeviceSinkBuilder::open_default_sink`), silences the drop log
  (`log_on_drop(false)`), and builds the single loop `Player` on the device's
  mixer. `Audio` owns the device; dropping it stops everything.
- `Audio::play_once(&sound)` — **one-shot, parallel overlap**: a copy of the
  buffer is `amplify`-ed by the master volume and `add`-ed to the mixer, so
  the same sound re-triggers freely and copies overlap. The volume is frozen
  at trigger time.
- `Audio::play_loop(&sound)` / `stop_loop()` — **loop, single sequential
  player**: `play_loop` `clear()`s, `append`s `buffer.repeat_infinite()`,
  `play()`s (a `clear` leaves the player paused, so the `play()` is
  load-bearing), and sets the loop's volume. Only one sound loops at a time;
  `play_loop` on a running loop restarts with the new sound. `stop_loop`
  `clear()`s. The master volume applies to the loop live.
- `Audio::set_volume(v)` — clamps to `0.0..=1.0` and stores the f32 bits in
  an `AtomicU32` (no cast needed: rodio's `Float`/`Sample` are `f32`); it
  updates the loop player immediately and one-shots from the next trigger.
- `AudioError` — hand-rolled `Debug` enum with a manual `Display`/`source()`
  in the project's `TextError`/`SpriteError` style: `Io(std::io::Error)`,
  `Decode(rodio::decoder::DecoderError)` (held by value; `Clone`), and
  `Device(Box<rodio::DeviceSinkError>)` (boxed because the device error is
  not `Clone`).

Tests are **device-free** (no `DeviceSinkBuilder`/`Audio::new()`), so
`cargo test` runs headless: a synthetic in-code PCM16 WAV decodes to the
right channel/rate/length, the bundled `swoof.wav` decodes, a missing path is
`AudioError::Io`, garbage bytes are `AudioError::Decode`, and the
`clamp01`/f32-bits helpers round-trip. `Sound::load_bytes` carries a doctest
that decodes an in-code WAV.

## Diagnostics (src/diagnostics.rs)

`Diagnostics` is a HUD overlay whose statistics are each gated by a bit of
the `DiagnosticsFlags` set passed to the constructor. The window size line
(`"{w}x{h}"`) is always shown, and below it the enabled statistics in fixed
order, all at a base 32 px that the display scale (Alt+'+' / Alt+'-', under
*Keyboard shortcuts*) grows or shrinks together: the smoothed frame rate (`"FPS {fps}"`, the `FPS`
bit), the current frame time (`"FT {ms}ms"`, the `FT` bit), the last
frame's total processing time (`"PROC {ms}ms"`, the `PROC` bit), that time
excluding the overlay's own update cost (`"APP {ms}ms"` — the companion line
to `PROC`, on the same bit), and the last frame's GPU draw-call count
(`"DRAW {n}"`, the `DRAW` bit). Under the lines, one scrolling ten-second
strip chart per enabled statistic group, top to bottom: frame rate (orange),
frame time (green), the folded processing-time chart, and the folded
draw-call chart. The two folded charts show three polylines on one shared
scale — the total (blue / magenta), the app's share (violet / pink), and
the overlay's own share (cyan / deep rose) — so the overlay's cost is
readable as the vertical gap between the total and the app lines; the FPS
and FT charts are single series, and the three time charts carry a
reference line at 60 fps / 16.7 ms (the draw-call chart has none — draw
counts have no universal budget). The processing times and the draw-call
counts are the engine's own probes; the APP lines and the diagnostic series
are the overlay subtracting its own measured costs from those probes — see
the probe bullets below. The whole integration is one struct in the demo
state plus one `self.diag.process(ctx, dt)` call per frame — the overlay
itself is a `Process`.

- `DiagnosticsFlags` is a hand-rolled four-bit set — `FPS (1 << 0)`,
  `FT (1 << 1)`, `PROC (1 << 2)`, `DRAW (1 << 3)` — with `ALL`, `NONE`,
  `none()` / `all()`, `contains()` / `is_empty()` / `insert()` /
  `remove()`, and `|` / `|=` (no dependency). `Diagnostics::new(path,
  flags)` reads the font file up front (checked with swash, so a bad path
  or file is a `TextError` at construction); `from_bytes(&[u8], flags)` is
  the no-filesystem twin (embedded `include_bytes!`, the wasm path). The
  bytes live behind an `Arc` shared with the readout's `Shape::Text`. The
  engine's probes always run; the flags gate only what the overlay
  displays, and an off flag costs nothing on the display side.
- `Process::process` smooths the frame rate as an exponential moving average
  of `1.0 / dt` (time constant 0.25 s, snapping to the first real
  measurement so the first frame does not flash a zero; `dt` 0.0 on the
  first frame is skipped; `dt` past a 0.25 s stall is skipped by the
  smoothing), records the raw frame time for the `FT` line, reads the
  engine's processing-time and draw-call probes (total and diagnostic),
  derives the `APP` line and the diagnostic series from the previous call
  (see the probe bullets), and appends a `Sample` (elapsed time, frame
  time, total/diagnostic/app processing times, total/diagnostic/app
  draw-call counts) to a history trimmed to the last 10 s. Each line's
  shape is rebuilt only when its text changes — the frame-time line shows
  the raw last gap, so it usually changes every frame.
- The processing-time probe lives in the backend, because the demo's
  `process` callback runs *inside* the frame — a demo cannot time its own
  frame from inside it. `Frost` measures `now_millis()` around its frame
  work in `render` (from just after the surface acquire — the acquire may
  wait on the display's back buffer, and that wait is not processing — to
  the `queue.submit` of the frame's command buffer; the present handoff and
  the wait for the next frame are excluded) and stores the result as
  `frame_processing_ms`, which the next frame's `Context` reports as
  `Context::frame_processing_ms()`. The draw-call probe counts in the same
  pass: one increment per `pass.draw` / `pass.draw_indexed` that actually
  executes (seven sites in the render loop — line, polyline, circle,
  rectangle, shape, sprite, particle batch), so draws skipped as off-screen,
  background, light, or empty (a degenerate transform, an empty particle
  batch) never count. It keeps two counters — `frame_draw_calls` and
  `frame_diagnostic_draw_calls`, reported as
  `Context::frame_draw_calls()` and `Context::frame_diagnostic_draw_calls()`
  — and the diagnostic one increments only when the draw's node carries the
  `SceneNode::diagnostic` marker, which the overlay sets on the nodes it
  appends to the scene. The marker is a public but engine-managed field
  (public so node literals with `..Default::default()` keep working from
  outside the crate; demo code leaves it at the default `false`), and it
  rides onto every draw the tagged nodes produce — the per-glyph quads of
  the text lines included — so the diagnostic count is a true subset of
  the total and the app's share is `total − diagnostic`. The overlay
  therefore always shows the last *completed* frame's numbers — a one-frame
  lag, one 0.1 s column at 60 fps, invisible in the graphs. `0.0` / `0`
  until the first frame completes (one `PROC 0.00ms` / `DRAW 0` flash, same
  as the `FT 0.0ms` flash).
- The APP value is the one probe the overlay makes itself, and it must be
  one frame behind for the same reason: it times its own `process` call
  with the engine's `now_millis` (crate-internal, shared with the backend)
  and stores the duration as `prev_self_ms`; the next call subtracts it from
  the engine's total probe of the *same* completed frame, clamped at zero
  against timer jitter, so PROC and APP always describe the same frame. It
  removes the overlay's per-frame *update* work (readout layout, sample
  binning, node placement); the overlay's own shape draws still count in
  the total — they go through the engine's per-draw path like everything
  else — which is what the diagnostic series on the folded charts shows.
- The strip charts are the history binned by time: `slice_max` takes the max
  of a per-sample projection over each 0.1 s column across the last 10 s
  (the fps column is the max of `1000 / frame_time`, i.e. the frame's
  fastest rate; the other columns project their own field), so a spike is
  visible as a high point, and the newest frame lands in the newest column.
  Each series' 100 column maxima become one `Shape::Polyline` (a point per
  column center, the value scaled to the panel height with a 1 px inset) —
  one draw call per series instead of 200 per-frame rectangle draws, because
  the cost of a draw in this engine is on the CPU side (a fresh uniform
  buffer + bind group + scissor/pipeline state per draw), not in the
  fragment work. Each folded chart keeps one scale: processing time is
  0–20 ms (the reference line at 16.7 ms), draw calls a fixed 0–128 (clipped
  above it — the readout always shows the true count).
- Node management: the slot lists are built once at construction from the
  flags — the lines in order (the size line first, then the enabled
  statistics), one panel per enabled chart, one reference line per chart
  except the draw-call chart, one polyline per series (one for the FPS and
  FT charts, three for the folded ones) — so all four flags give at most 21
  nodes (six lines, four panels, three references, eight polylines), and
  `none()` gives a single line. The first `process` creates a **dedicated
  topmost `Layer`** — ordered one past the highest existing layer (or above
  the root subtree when there are none) — and appends the nodes to that
  layer's root, remembering the indices; later calls update each node's
  shape and transform in place. A stale index (the demo rebuilt the scene's
  layers) recreates the layer and re-appends the nodes. Because a `Layer` is
  a hard draw partition, the overlay can never be buried under a
  high-order app node, and the demo is free to reorder its root's children.
  Placement uses crate-internal `text::layout` for each line's width; the
  lines' vertical extent is measured once, at construction, over every
  character a readout line can display, because neither the current text's
  ink (Fira Code's "8" and "9" carry a pixel of antialiasing below the
  baseline where the "4" does not) nor the font's metrics (both bundled
  fonts report degenerate ones — Leofont's ascent plus descent is about a
  pixel at 32 px) is a stable extent — so the topmost *visible* line's ink
  sits 20 px in from the window's top-left corner, and the visible parts
  reflow into that corner whenever one of them is hidden.
- Keyboard shortcuts: the overlay reads eight key combinations from the
  engine's key state on every `process`, acting on press edges only (a
  held combination toggles once): Alt-0 is the master switch — while off,
  every node draws nothing and the per-part toggles are remembered as-is —
  Alt-1..Alt-4 toggle the charts by position among the enabled charts (top
  chart first; the extra keys are no-ops when fewer than four charts are
  enabled), Alt-T toggles all the readout lines, the window-size line
  included, and Alt+'+' / Alt+'-' grow or shrink the whole overlay — font,
  margins, gaps and chart panels together — stepped by a quarter of the
  current size and clamped between a quarter and four times the base. The
  zoom pair matches **typed characters** (`+`/`=`/`±`/`−` grow,
  `-`/`_`/`–`/`—` shrink, numpad included) so it follows the user's layout:
  physical codes name US positions, where the Swedish `+` key sits on the
  US `-`; the line extent re-measures at the new font size, so the stacked
  lines stay even and every laid-out line re-lays out on its next refresh.
  The charts are independent of the text toggle. The layout
  reflows around whatever is hidden — the visible lines and charts re-pack
  into the corner — while the node indices stay fixed to the construction
  slot order; a hidden node keeps its place as a bare pivot (`shape:
  None`). While the text is hidden, the lines are not rebuilt, and a
  re-shown line re-lays out its last text the next visible frame. The
  shortcuts are read, not consumed: a demo that wants the same
  combinations still sees them. They are also available as the methods
  `toggle_all()`, `toggle_chart(index)`, `toggle_text()`, `scale()`, and
  `set_scale(scale)`.
- Pure CPU work (no device I/O), so it compiles on `wasm32` too — no cfg
  gate, unlike `audio`.

`examples/diagnostics.rs` shows it over a swaying circle, set in
`assets/fonts/FiraCode-VariableFont_wght.ttf`, with `DiagnosticsFlags::all()`;
`examples/particles/square_fountains.rs` runs it over a live particle scene.

## UI (src/ui/)

`Ui` is an **immediate-mode widget layer** over the frame's `Canvas`: the
app owns one `Ui` in its `Process` struct, calls `Ui::begin(ctx)` at the top
of `process` (snapshot the mouse, resolve last frame's press, move the
dragged panel), then declares widgets each frame — `button` (armed-release
click, as in `examples/button.rs`), `checkbox` (drives `&mut bool`),
`slider` (label left, value readout right, drag-follows-pointer, drives
`&mut f32`), `label`, `space`, and `panel`. Returns: `true` on the frame a
button clicks, a checkbox toggles, a slider's value changes.

- **Panels** are titled boxes anchored at a center `at` until the user
  **drags them by the title bar**; the dragged position is retained per
  title (hashed id). The body is as tall as the content asked for *last*
  frame (first frame shows the title bar only, then it snaps open), and it
  grows **downward from the anchored title bar**. A **click** on the title
  bar (a release that barely moved — measured from where the press began,
  so dragging never folds) **folds** the panel to just its bar and folds it
  back; a chevron on the bar shows the state. Widgets outside any panel
  stack in a root column at the window's top-left. A
  panel **claims its whole area** (body included): presses land on the
  panel, never on a widget or the game behind it, and `Ui::hovering()` —
  the pointer over any widget or panel — lets a raw-input game tell UI
  clicks from scene clicks (see `tools/sprite_util/process.rs`). Two accessors
  reach a panel from outside: `Ui::panel_position(title)` reads where it
  sits, `Ui::panel_rect(title)` reports the plate as it was PAINTED last
  call (the height the drawing used — content laid over a plate must
  trust this, not its own same-frame request, or it floats a frame
  ahead of the pixels; see `tools/sprite_util/process.rs`), and
  `Ui::set_folded(title, folded)` is the program's hand on the title-bar
  click — code that closes or restores a panel uses it so a reopened
  title never greets you folded.
- **The input model** is one frame delayed: a press is resolved at the next
  `begin` against the rects the previous frame registered, last-declared
  (topmost) first — so overlapping panels route presses to the visible one,
  and a press that leaves a widget keeps its drag until release (sliders,
  panel drags). Hover, click and hold all read this resolved state.
- **Tables** (`Ui::table(ctx, id, cols, content)`) lay the widgets declared
  in `content` into a grid: each consumes the next cell, wrapping to a new
  row after `cols.len()`. Each `Col` has a [`ColSize`] — `Px` (fixed),
  `Auto` (as wide as its widest cell, from last frame, matching the UI's
  one-frame model) or `Stretch(w)` (a weighted share of the leftover) — and
  an [`Align`] (`Left`/`Center`/`Right`) honored by text. `slider_track` and
  `readout` are the label-less pieces for a `[label | track | value]` row
  (see `tools/sprite_util/process.rs`); `id` scopes the retained auto widths so
  two tables in one panel keep their own columns.
- **Tree view** (`tree.rs`) is the same widget family's two-axis-scrolling
  list: `TreeLine` rows (key, value, a few flags, a value color) in a
  resizable, scrollable panel — close `×`, corner grip, both scroll thumbs,
  per-row fold/delete buttons, drag-reorder of deletable rows — driven
  through `TreeSpec`/`TreeState` and answering `TreeEvent`s **by row index**
  only: the widget knows nothing of the app's data model. `sprite_util`'s
  sidecar panels and `ron_view` are its two applications (there
  `frost::ron` and `examples/ron_view/view.rs` are the data and row
  sides, here it is the widget).
- **Identity**: widget ids are FNV-1a hashes of the label scoped by the
  containing panel's id, so the same label in two panels is two widgets.
- **Text** goes through `Canvas::text` (see above) with one shared
  `Arc<[u8]>` font (`Ui::from_font` / `from_bytes`, validated at
  construction), so all UI text shares one cached glyph atlas; measured
  widths are cached per `(string, size, weight)`; the weight is
  `UiStyle::font_weight` (default 600 — a SemiBold on a variable font like
  FiraCode, inert on static fonts).
- **Order**: every UI draw gets a `z` counting up from
  `UiStyle::base_z` (default 10 000) in declaration order — the UI paints
  over the scene, panels stack in declaration order.
- `UiStyle` is one `Copy` struct of colors and metrics (dark default),
  reachable through `ui.style`.

## Testing

Baseline: **346 lib tests + 3 integration tests (`tests/`) + 7 doctests**
passing, `cargo build` (lib + the `sprite_util` tool) clean. The tool's 81
tests — 68 that moved with `examples/sprite_util.rs`, each living in the
subject module it pins, the asset-path guard, the three
authored-shapes overlay tests, and the nine that pin the status band's
log (capture by change, the cap, the window and thumb arithmetic, the
dock's geometry) — ride along in the same
`cargo test` now that it is a binary target. Notable test areas:

- `src/shaders.rs` — naga parse + device-side validation (the
  `Validator` stage wgpu runs in `create_shader_module` — this is what
  catches uniform-address-space layout rules the parser never checks) +
  uniform-offset assertions (above).
- `src/backend/tests/` — mostly GPU-free: uniform-layout mirrors, scissor
  math, `paint_order`, `expand_text` (splicing + atlas reuse across frames),
  `context_reports_held_mouse_button`, `context_reports_mouse_wheel_delta`,
  and the context's typed-character read (`char_down`).
- `src/backend/tests/shadows.rs` — the exception, and the reason the rule is
  stated: it renders the real packed occluder field through the real
  `shape.wgsl` on whatever adapter the machine has, and compares every pixel
  with `collision::occluded`. That agreement cannot be checked from either
  side alone, so this is the one place a drift between the CPU's slab test and
  the shader's can be caught; with no adapter it prints that the shadow went
  unverified rather than passing quietly. A box is required to agree exactly,
  away from where its shadow edge crosses between neighbouring pixels; a disc
  gets the tessellation's own bound instead, which needs no invented epsilon
  because containment does the work — the sixteen-gon contains the circle it
  inscribes and is contained in the one it is inscribed in, and a shadow grows
  with the shape casting it, so its shadow must sit between theirs (outside the
  disc, where the receiver-inside rule is silent for all three), with the
  disagreement counted to show the band is as thin as `DISC_SIDES` claims.
- `src/diagnostics.rs` — press-edge detection for all eight shortcuts, the
  display-scale clamp, and the line-extent re-measure on scale change.
- `src/ui/menu.rs` — the bar's state machine without a canvas, and the
  notes' paint geometry: right-aligned from the bar's far end with
  center-anchored text (a note's center, never its edge, steps by half
  widths), a `...`-led tail kept when a note overruns the room the titles
  leave — the tail is the half that says something — and the earliest
  notes falling off first.
- `tests/` — headless `Shape::sprite` reads of the `dogs_name` art (frame
  fit, ink statistics), through the same public entry point the examples use.
- `src/physics.rs` — the elastic impulse's two conserved ledgers (energy and
  momentum, checked against closed-form one-dimensional results and a
  three-body round), the inverse-weight split of a shared penetration, and
  the anti-stick rule that a separating pair is separated but never sped up.
- `src/collision.rs` — push-out separation, reflect restitution semantics,
  and the convex occluder polygon: what it refuses rather than repair, the
  receiver-inside rule, and the two-percent band a tessellated disc keeps from
  the round one.
- `src/bake.rs` — each role's fusion policy, quarter-turn equivalence, what
  gets rejected and why, and a sampled coverage property: a fused set covers
  exactly the points the authored boxes covered, on random piles and on a
  half-filled tile lattice.
- `src/shapes.rs` — the sidecar's `shapes:` vocabulary end to end: sidecar
  text through `ron::parse_doc`, the reader, a real `Baker` and
  `declare_occluders`; the pixel-to-node flip pinned by an asymmetric case;
  and the refusals — every error reported not just the first, a tuple
  position answered with the tool's spot rule, capsules and concave outlines
  refused by name. The two arms agree: the drawing arm keeps every outline
  whose geometry read while the refusals pile up beside them, and a role the
  bake refuses reaches the tool and the baker as one and the same sentence.
  The load-time seam too: `bake_sidecar` against the real shipped files —
  a missing sidecar bakes nothing, an `atlas`-only one bakes nothing,
  `brick.ron` bakes the hall's one bouncy footprint — while a mis-authored
  file fails the load with the whole report and an unparseable one travels
  as a RON failure, never a log line.
- `src/ron.rs` — the RON subset itself: atoms, numbers and enum paths kept
  verbatim, comments as noise that still survives the writer, errors that carry
  a line number, and `assets/ron/garden.ron` round-tripped to a fixed point —
  the property that makes the file safe for a tool to rewrite at all. (The
  sprite sidecar fixture is round-tripped over in `sprite_util`'s own tests,
  where the tool that rewrites it lives.)
- `src/tween.rs`, `src/particles.rs`, `src/text.rs` — behavior unit tests.
- `src/rng.rs` — a fixed seed replays its stream; `state()`/`set_state()`
  round-trips continue it exactly.
- `src/audio.rs` — device-free decode tests (synthetic WAV, bundled
  `swoof.wav`, error variants) + the `load_bytes` doctest.
- `src/ui/` — the interaction model driven frame by frame through
  `begin_input` (press arming, armed release, hold past the rect, topmost
  overlap wins, one-frame click, panel drag moves by the pointer delta and
  retains), plus id hashing and rect math.

## Examples (examples/)

48 demos, filed into subject folders — `shapes/`, `lighting/`, `inout/`,
`layers/`, `particles/`, `physics/`, `text/`, the `immortal/` game, and the
tools (`worm`, `tilemap`, …) at the top level. Cargo only auto-discovers
`examples/*.rs` and `examples/*/main.rs`, so every folder member is named
with an explicit `[[example]]` entry in `Cargo.toml` — the short names keep
working: `cargo run --example parallax`. `ron_view/` is the exception that
proves the rule: a `main.rs` folder target needs no entry, and its RON-subset
parser, tree model and writer (every value carries its source comments
through parse, edit and save) now live in the crate as `src/ron.rs`, so
both examples parse sidecars and samples with the crate's own
dependency-free parser; what stayed in the example is the row flattener
(`view.rs`, path-included by `sprite_util` too), which flattens a tree
into the folded rows both viewers paint. Most load their
assets from disk at runtime, pinned to the crate root via
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`; `immortal` and `text_web` embed their assets into the
binary with `include_bytes!` instead, so they run with no asset files on
disk. Run with `cargo run --example <name>`
(`RUST_LOG=info` for logs; on Windows PowerShell:
`RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example gizmos 2>&1 | Out-String`).

`sprite_util` is no longer in this folder or this package: the tool lives
at [`tools/sprite_util/`](tools/sprite_util/main.rs) as its own workspace
package — run with `cargo run -p sprite_util`, tested by plain `cargo test`
(see [`docs/tooling.md`](docs/tooling.md)). Its `ron_view` row flattener is
still the one in `examples/ron_view/view.rs`, path-included across the
directory line: a known debt until a second tool proves the view is shared
tool surface. The tool's one `main.rs` became a crate of its own subjects:
`theme` (colors, z-orders, pool ids), `layout` (zoom, pan, selection),
`world` (sprites, the bench, the undo history), `art` (PNG codec, asset
paths), `strip` (the slot strip), `journal` (the status band's log),
`band` (the tileset rack), `spots` and `sidecar` and `ron_panels` (the
positions, the `.ron` files, their foldable trees), `map` and `clip` (the
tile-map desk and the clipboard block), `desk` (the `Demo` state and its
frame sync), `draw` and `process` (the frame: painters read one
`FrameState` geometry record the handlers fill once), and `actions` —
where a planned verb is born: a menu line and its method, side by side.
Each module's `mod tests` holds the tests that pin its subject. The
`sprite_util` row below stays as the description.

| lighting     | a lit floor, a lit ball with an ember plume, three lights sweeping  |

| lit_unlit    | two same-color rectangles — one `lit: true` — and a light on the    |

| cone         | a square explorer carries a torch (a cone `Light`) through a dark   |
|              | hall of occluding walls                                             |
| dawn         | one directional light as a day cycle: sunrise, climb, sunset, the   |

| eyes         | glowing eyes drifting through the dark — a tour of `SceneNode::glow`|
| eyes_light   | the companion: some eyes are real emitters (`Shape::Light` too)     |
| particles    | a `ParticleSystem` fountain with life-fraction alpha               |

|              | CPU-simulated batch (one instanced draw per `Shape::Particles` node)  |

|              | spout-emitted water particles over a full-screen grass field       |
| torch        | two kinds of particles side by side: embers that ride the torch and |
|              | sparks that keep flying once they leave it                          |
| worm         | one sprite crawling by peristalsis — a stretch anchored at the rear |
|              | and a contract anchored at the front (matched so the center glides  |
|              | smoothly), a 2 px bob at twice the beat, wrapping at the window's   |
|              | physical edges (scale-factor honest); 960×540 via `Config`          |
| sound        | one-shot + looping playback of a decoded WAV: Space re-triggers     |
|              | (pulsing circle), L toggles the loop (wobbling ring), +/- the bar   |
| audio_test   | a raw rodio scratchpad: plays WAV/MP3 straight through rodio,      |
|              | beside (not through) frost's `Audio` wrapper                        |
| button       | a "play" button: hovering tweens the node's `scale` to 1.1 (rebuilt |
|              | on every hover edge) so rect and label grow together; a press edge  |
|              | over the button arms it, and an armed release over the button plays |
|              | the swoosh once                                                     |
| tomato_sprite| the tomato sprite with its `tomato_fg.png` overlay, both siblings   |
|              | under a shapeless dummy parent node, both at the same draw order:   |
|              | the tie resolves in tree order, so the later sibling (the overlay)  |
|              | draws on top; each child puts the image px `(308, 411)` on          |
|              | the parent's origin; the parent carries the inverse, so the         |
|              | image's center sits on the window's center                          |
| immortal     | 1920x1080 (Config window_size); four tools ride the shelf items.png |
|              | paints: the sprite's four bays ARE the four slots - BAYS holds each |
|              | bay's opening centre and its board-top rest line, read off the      |
|              | sprite's luminance bands; a bay's ceiling is its click cell's own   |
|              | cut, so the bays stand 214/213.5/214/207 px tall and every tool is  |
|              | drawn at `tool_scale` - the largest size that fits every bay, so    |
|              | nothing changes size as it moves along the shelf; tweezers, spade,  |
|              | spray can, watering can top to bottom, click a bay to swap          |
|              | with it, right button trades held for stored; a fresh left click    |
|              | digs one spade stroke - `dig_offset`: shoved DIG_PUSH_DIST px along |
|              | its own drawn line (34.9 deg below horizontal, read off the art),   |
|              | held buried DIG_HOLD s, then arched up and left over the hole it    |

|              | landing on its back; then over 0.5 s the inverted sprite evaporates,|
|              | shrinking to nothing while its center sinks through the grass; after|
|              | a random 5-10 s delay the bug pops back up at its spawn spot, fully |
|              | healed; the five slices' joints and flower anchors load at startup  |
|              | from the embedded `assets/sprites/plant1..5.ron` files (serde + ron —|
|              | the hand-picked constants are gone); a 14-slot worm swarm burrows up|
|              | and walks the bench on the `worm` example's stride — the rear grips |
|              | while the body reaches, the front holds while the contract slides it|
|              | up — two poses riding the stride's halves, hull-picked spawn/target |
|              | spots off a seedable `Rng`, and digs back in; every draw order      |
|              | composes through the `zorder` module's bands (ground = −y, bench    |
|              | slots on top, grass/UI/overlay pinned outside); F5 / F9 save & reload|
|              | the whole game as versioned RON under `~/.frost/immortal/` — the    |

| sprite_util  | up to seven picked PNGs (rfd dialogs): the window splits into a     |

|              | minimized originals (click a slot to activate, drag one onto        |
|              | another to swap). The active sprite shows over a checkerboard with  |
|              | `Ui` View and Operations panels (Open / Crop / Save / Save As /     |
|              | Close): a left-drag draws a crop selection (a still click logs the  |
|              | texture pixel), Ctrl-O opens into the next slot, Ctrl-Z undoes      |
|              | crops, Save/Save As write PNG over a native confirm. An Animation   |

|              | played on a clock that loops or ping-pongs (space plays), previewed |
|              | live in the work area. A sprite with a sidecar `<name>.ron` beside  |
|              | its PNG gets its own `Ui` panel titled by the file — one view per   |
|              | open file, cascading from the lower right, each dragging, folding,  |
|              | scrolling by its own pair of handles (wheel too, Shift-wheel         |
|              | sideways) and resizing by a corner grip; the boxed × in a view's    |
|              | bar closes file and panel together — laid out on the plate the      |
|              | UI actually painted, never a frame ahead of it                      |

|              | right-click a marker to pick it back — the tree unfolds to the      |
|              | row and scrolls it to centre. Left-click the sprite to move the     |
|              | position, Escape lets go; other rows fold on click. Save /          |
|              | Save As write the tree back beside the PNG with its comments —      |

`cursor.rs` is the most complete reference demo: `CAN_IMAGE [331,247]` scaled
to 100 px, a 90° CCW tilt tween (0.5 s, rebuilt on press/release edges),
spout at image px (0,25), a 120/s emission accumulator, semi-implicit water
droplets under gravity 420, life-fraction alpha, and a splitmix64 `Rng` for
spread/life/size randomization.

## Load-bearing invariants (don't break these)

1. **Node transform order**: `scale` innermost, then the node's `transform`,
   then the parent's world — `world_at` and `draw_node` both follow it, and
   the `can_transform`-style compositions in examples match it (e.g.
   `cursor.rs` matches the unrotated pointer-follow exactly at angle 0).
2. **Uniform layout**: CPU byte offsets in `frame.rs` ↔ WGSL uniform structs ↔
   naga tests must all agree (`[0,16,24,32,48,64]`, span 80 for shape/sprite).
3. **AA band**: `AA_BAND = 0.75` in `frame.rs` and the `aa` constant in the
   shader sources must stay equal, or scissor boxes stop covering every pixel
   the shaders can write.
4. **`Tween` has no re-target** — rebuild on edges.
5. **Per-draw uniform buffers** are mandatory (write_buffer batch semantics).
6. **Sprite/atlas texture sharing** is keyed by the `Arc<[u8]>` pointer plus
   the buffer's generation (0 for static images, bumped by `text::Atlas` on
   every repack) — the pixel buffer must be the same allocation (clone the
   `Arc`, don't copy bytes) for the sharing to work. When an atlas repacks,
   its stale texture is evicted from `sprite_resources` right after
   `expand_text`, so the fresh buffer uploads in the same frame.
7. **Text expansion happens before sorting**, so glyphs inherit the node's
   paint position.
8. The **last** `Background` in call order wins as the clear color.
9. **Authored shapes stay local.** `Baker`'s output and `Canvas::occluder`'s
   arguments are a shape in its own space plus a transform, never world-space
   corners — which is also why a `Convex` occluder ships half-planes and not
   corners: a turned or mirrored instance needs no second polygon and no
   re-derived normals, and the y-flip to the framebuffer reverses a winding
   that was never asked to mean anything: a turned, non-uniformly scaled rectangle is not an oriented box, so
   baking it into coordinates would force an approximation of the shear — on the
   GPU, which pulls the pixel into the shape's space rather than pushing a
   sheared box out, and on the CPU alike.

## Direction

The queue moved into the game it serves: `examples/immortal/TODO.md` carries
the immortal wish-list — graphics (shop icon, progression toward immortality,
level indicators), sound effects, music, and the fruit's ripen-rot-fall cycle.
The library's last queue entry, the `Body` type, shipped as `src/physics.rs`
with the `bodies` example as its demo; the physics section's `rapier2d` note
stays the documented escape hatch if it ever outgrows itself.

**Asset identity moves from paths to names.** The key finding: a shipped app
is one self-contained binary — assets arrive via `include_bytes!` at compile
time (`immortal`'s `assets_load.rs` is the pattern), so a saved file that
names `assets/sprites/basic_tiles.png` refers to a place that does not exist
in the binary. The one noun that survives all three worlds — repo (resolved
by `asset_path` beside the crate root), loose runtime (an `assets/` folder
next to the binary), shipped (a `const ASSETS: &[(&str, &[u8])]` name table
of `include_bytes!` entries) — is the **asset name**: the file stem. The
house already treats the stem as the key (`<stem>.ron` rides `<stem>.png`);
what was sloppy was carrying it around inside a path.

**Two tilesets can share a sprite — and the desk used to be blind to it
(fixed 2026-10-10).** The atlas grid is per-loaded-instance state, so the
same PNG can sit in two slots cut two ways (1×4 here, 2×8 there).
`MapLayer` stamped provenance by path alone and the tile desk dressed with
first-match — so a layer painted against one grid got dressed from a
same-path slot with the other. The identity is now what it always
meant: `TilesetRef { name, rows, cols }` — the file's stem plus the cut
made into it, which fully determines a cell's picture and code — and the
map's save format inherits that meaning from the field it stamps.
`one_file_cut_two_ways_stays_two_tilesets` pins it, and the storage
language it introduced (`asset_name` in `art.rs`: a path says where a
file was found, a name says what it is) is the first rung of the name
architecture above.

**Maps get a file: `.map.ron`, names throughout.** The tile desk paints
`Vec<MapLayer>` and nothing persists it — an evening of tiling evaporates
at window close. The format follows the identity above —
`(tileset: ("basic_tiles", 2, 8), cols: .., rows: .., cells: [(col, row,
code, tfm), ..])` — sparse (cell 0 is not written), the orientation byte
riding with the cell because the transform is the map's memory, layers
keeping the order the desk renders. `Save map` / `Open map` are born in
`actions.rs` as the first planned verbs on that seam; opening a map pulls
the tilesets it names that the bench lacks, setting the recorded grid with
the existing `set_atlas` machinery; a tileset the file names that nothing
can find gets the house treatment — first refusal named, the rest counted,
spoken on the status band like `shapes_note`.

Landed 2026-10-10, with one remainder on the record: the codec and both
verbs shipped — cells written `(x, y, code, tfm)` from the layer's
top-left, empties never written, refusals named by the reader and spoken
by the opener — but the opener does not yet *pull* missing tilesets from
disk. Their layers wait dressed-as-nothing, which the desk has always
known how to do; pulling them by house convention is the increment that
closes this paragraph.

**The name table is also the hot-reload seam — the shipping model and the
dev loop turn out to share one interface.** Game code never says
`include_bytes!`; it says *give me `basic_tiles`*, and one resolver sits
behind that request: the const table in release, the same names read from
disk under a watcher in debug. Same code, same bytes-to-GPU path — the
decode-from-bytes entry points already serve both worlds — so a tileset
saved in `sprite_util` lands in a running game the next frame, process
state untouched (immediate mode keeps UI state nearly stateless, and not
restarting keeps the game's own state: the state preservation Godot buys
with a scene graph, frost gets for free). The ladder, cheapest first:
**data** (a gameplay `.ron` re-parsed on mtime change — the app rebuilds
config from the root; more than Godot offers for data-driven play, and
free); **textures, audio, fonts** (mtime → decode → `write_texture` →
rebind by name); **maps** (re-parse and rebuild the tilemap shapes — free
once data exists); **shaders** (`create_render_pipeline` is a runtime
call and naga is already a dependency — watching the `.wgsl` files is
surprisingly easy, and it is where frost can embarrass the big engines);
**code**, honestly last: incremental `cargo run` is the floor, and a true
hot swap means a cdylib game crate swapped by a dylib reloader with state
held host-side across an ABI-stable seam — a tax the API would carry
forever, so if it ever comes it comes as a documented *app pattern*, never
a frost API.

Landed 2026-10-10 as `frost::Assets` (src/assets.rs): a `Table` of
name-and-bytes compiled into the binary, loose directories admitted
above it by stem, and one request answering both worlds — immortal's
44 assets all flow through it, and its release binary boots from
`/tmp` with nothing on disk but itself. One finding the road
produced: **a name is the full request only when the format is
known** — the sprite directories keep their `.ron` sidecars beside
the PNGs, and `Getingeye1.ron` shadowed its own sprite's bytes until
the ask learned to name its formats (`asset(name, exts)`); name and
format together dress an ask, exactly as name and cut identify a
tileset. The watcher (mtime → decode → rebind) remains the tiers' to
raise; today's resolver reads loose files when asked.

**And one guard the name table makes possible:** a small reader (say
`frost::map::tileset_names`) lists the names a map file asks for, so an
app's own test can assert every one of them sits in its `ASSETS` table —
a forgotten `include_bytes!` dies at `cargo test`, not in the field. The
resolver core, the watcher tick, and the rebind-mid-swap semantics are
still to be designed; this paragraph is the finding, not the plan. The
engines this bet is made against, and the scoreboard tracking it, live in
`COMPARISON.md`.

**Tools are guests: the app is the truth, so design the telling.** In
Godot the scene tree *is* the application — a file (`*.tscn`) that the
editor mutates as ground truth and the game merely renders. In frost the
inverse holds: truth is a running program, and the scene tree is a frame
artifact — `process()` manufactures it from app state every frame and
discards it — so no tool can *extract* an application's state of affairs;
it can only be *told*. The architecture that follows has two clocks, one
mechanism, and one discipline.

*Document truth* serves the selected, sleeping application: whatever the
author wants tools to see lives in the RON dialect on purpose — save
games already do (immortal carries its `Rng` stream in `.ron`), maps will
(`.map.ron`), gameplay values will (the data tier above). Opening an
application in `sprite_util` then means: open its world document, read
which tilesets it names and at which cuts (`("basic_tiles", 2, 8)`), and
rebuild exactly those on the bench via the `set_atlas` machinery. The
document set is the app's identity while it sleeps.

*Live truth* serves the running application: it announces itself with a
small card in a well-known folder (say `target/frost/live/` — name, pid,
asset root, where its live file is; deleted on exit, stale entries pruned
by pid liveness), which is what "attach to the *selected* application"
means concretely — a tool enumerates the folder like a debugger lists
processes. The app then publishes `fn state_of_affairs(&self) ->
frost::ron::Val` — its own being in its own words, one hand-written
function, zero cost where absent, no reflection tax and no shared Rust
types across the tool boundary; tools read the tree with the parser they
already have.

The snapshot is *transition-driven, not clock-driven, and it carries
structure only*. Streaming data (tweens, lerps, anything without
transitions) does not join the telling — a tool that wants continuous
values wants a socket, someday, not a file. What is published is the
app's static structure, so the file is not a stream at all but a
document with an author who lives in a process: idle apps write nothing,
ever. The clock is a dirty check, and the house already owns both idioms
it needs: value-key dirtiness (the checker backdrop's
`if key != self.checker_key` — serialize once, compare against last
published, and since the serialization *is* the snapshot, the check is
nearly free and a forgotten flag cannot hide a change) and set-and-flush
(the journal collapsing repeats: mutation sites set a bit, one flush at
the end of `process()` coalesces a burst — an erase touching forty cells
publishes once, not forty watcher fires). Every publish carries a
monotonic `rev` (tools that coalesce watcher events still know something
happened, and in what order; an unchanged `rev` says the write was a
heartbeat, not a change), and the first write happens at boot — a
freshly loaded, never-mutated app still has a structure worth seeing,
because coming into existence is a transition. Liveness stays the
announce card's pid question; change and life are different questions
and do not mix in one file. What this converges on: a dirty-driven
structure publish is an *autosave with manners* — same serialization,
same clock, same dialect, different folder — which folds the
sleeping/running duality shut: the save a dead app leaves and the
snapshot a living app keeps become one format from one function, so
opening a sleeping application and attaching to a running one is one
reader, two folders.

*One mechanism, both directions:* hot reload has the tool writing a
document while the app's watcher pulls; introspection has the app writing
a snapshot while the tool's watcher pulls. The watched-file primitive
designed for the reload ladder *is* the inter-tool bus — roles swap,
machinery doesn't. Sockets can wait until someone needs sub-frame
latency; files speak at editing speed. The name spine closes the loop:
snapshots name assets by name, so `sprite_util`, attached to a running
game, can answer "where does this tile I am editing appear?" — the
draw-list echo (a frame trace, if draws ever carry a debug tag) is a
later rung that has to earn its keep against the logic-side snapshot.

*One discipline:* tools write documents, never memories. There is
deliberately no push-into-the-running-app channel — Godot's bidirectional
scene editing is exactly the coupling frost refuses, an editor that must
own the truth or become a second author of a book it cannot read. The app
owns its being; the tools own the documents; the watcher is the only
courier. Summed up: Godot's editor edits the truth; frost's app *is* the
truth, so tools read documents (sleeping state) and snapshots (running
state), write only documents, and one watched-file mechanism carries
every word in both directions.

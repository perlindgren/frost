# FROST

A game engine experiment by N65 Game Research Station (N65 GRS).

Why?

- Primarily to gain experience of local hosted AI workflows.
- Sufficiently complex problem to challenge ability to reason on realistic use-cases.
- To gain human experience on inner workings of a games engine, starting from very limited, surface level understanding.
- If successful to provide the core mechanics of a library based games engine, following the Rust paradigms (unlike e.g., Bevy, that introduces an additional ECS abstraction to offer shared mutability.)

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for AI based workflow.

## Examples

Run the examples with:

```shell
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example gizmos
```

or under Win11 with Powershell:

```powershell
$env:RUST_LOG="info"; cargo run --example gizmos
```

## Repository hooks

The versioned hooks in `.githooks/` gate commits (fmt + clippy) and pushes
(tests), but git only runs them once this clone points at them — the
trigger is a per-clone setting, never cloned itself. After every fresh
clone, once:

```shell
sh .githooks/install.sh
```

(or clone with `git clone --config core.hooksPath=.githooks <url>` and skip
the step). On Windows from PowerShell or cmd, where `sh` is usually not on
the PATH, the script's whole job is the one command:
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — run it from any shell (from Git
Bash, `sh .githooks/install.sh` works as everywhere). They are a gate you
opt into, not a wall: `--no-verify` skips them by design.

# Activate the versioned hooks for THIS clone.
#
# Git only runs hooks it finds in .git/hooks/ — and .git/ is never cloned,
# so the link must be made once per clone: a single local config value
# redirects git at the versioned .githooks/ folder. Nothing else in the
# repo can do this from the tree side (git ignores hook settings in
# shared configs on purpose), so this file is the opt-in ritual:
#
#     sh .githooks/install.sh
#
# A fresh clone can skip the ritual and state it at creation time instead:
#
#     git clone --config core.hooksPath=.githooks <url>
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run any time; it just re-asserts the same value.
# Mind the honest limit: hooks are a gate you opt into, not a wall —
# `git commit --no-verify` skips them by design. The wall, if you ever
# want one, is server-side (a CI check or a pre-receive hook).

//! The telling: how a running application announces itself to its
//! guests.
//!
//! In frost the truth is a running program — the scene tree is a
//! frame artifact, manufactured and discarded — so a tool cannot
//! *extract* an application's state of affairs; it can only be
//! *told*. This module is the apparatus of telling: an announce
//! card in a well-known folder (tools enumerate it the way a
//! debugger lists processes), and a live file the application
//! re-publishes when its being changes.
//!
//! The telling is transition-driven and carries structure only.
//! The clock is a value-key dirty check — the serialization *is*
//! the snapshot, so comparing against the last published body is
//! nearly free and a forgotten flag cannot hide a change. Every
//! write carries a monotonic `rev`, and the first write happens at
//! boot: coming into existence is a transition. Idle apps write
//! nothing, ever — this is an autosave with manners, not a stream.
//!
//! Liveness stays the card's pid question — change and life are
//! different questions and do not mix in one file. The card dies
//! with the app (its `Drop`) and stale cards — crashed apps — are
//! pruned by pid liveness when a new app opens its folder. The
//! dialect is the house RON: tools read the tree with the parser
//! they already have, and tools write documents only.

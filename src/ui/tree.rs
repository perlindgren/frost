//! The tree view: a two-axis-scrolling list of `key: val` rows in a panel,
//! with a close `×` in the title bar, a corner grip that resizes the view,
//! vertical and horizontal scroll thumbs, per-row `+`/`×` buttons, and
//! drag-reorder of rows that show a `×`.
//!
//! It is deliberately generic over its rows: the library knows only
//! [`TreeLine`]s (key, value, a few flags, a value color) and emits events
//! with row *indices*; the application maps them to its own data model.
//! The default metrics and colors are those of the RON sidecar tree.
//!
//! **One call per frame, all views.** [`Ui::tree`] takes *every* view's
//! [`TreeSpec`] at once and returns one [`TreeOut`] per spec, in order.
//! The views share one [`TreeState`] owned by the application. Running the
//! release resolution over all views in one pass is what makes cross-view
//! semantics exact: a release that lands inside view 0's body *and* view
//! 1's close box closes view 1 (the close box wins), which no per-view
//! call sequence could reproduce, because view 0 would have claimed the
//! press first.
//!
//! **Claim order, one press frame.** A press claims the first thing that
//! contains the pointer, in spec order: the close box (even of a folded
//! view), then — for unfolded views — the corner grip, the vertical
//! thumb, the horizontal thumb, and finally the body. The first claim
//! wins; later views see nothing. A claim is consumed on the *release*
//! frame, always: a release whose travel from the press exceeds
//! [`CLICK_TOL`] is a failed click (nothing happens), but the press is
//! gone either way, so no stale claim can block a later press.
//!
//! **Drag start and move.** While a body press is held, a drift of
//! [`CLICK_TOL`] or more over a row whose `del` flag is set starts a
//! reorder drag (`DragStart`); afterwards the current row under the
//! pointer is reported every frame — including the release frame, which
//! reports the final seat before `DragEnd` — and the pointer leaving all
//! rows reports `Drag { row: None }`. A press on a row *without* the
//! `del` flag never drags, and if the release is still (travel below
//! tolerance) it clicks that row as usual.
//!
//! **Paint.** [`Ui::tree_paint`] paints one view: rows (windowed
//! horizontally by `sx` and cullable vertically), the selection band,
//! the `+`/`×` plates and glyphs, both scroll thumbs, the corner ticks
//! (for every unfolded view, even one whose body is too small to hold a
//! row), and the close `×` (for every view, folded or not). All of a
//! view's draws sit within `spec.z`, `spec.z - 0.5` and `spec.z - 0.45`,
//! so painting the views in any order is safe.

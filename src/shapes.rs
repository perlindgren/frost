//! The shapes an author drew in the picture, read out of a sprite's `.ron`
//! sidecar: the `shapes` key's entries, in one pass, as both views of them.
//!
//! The vocabulary is one flat list, one entry per shape, with the kind as
//! a field and the three consumers' roles as flags on the same entry — a
//! wall is solid *and* occluding, and one role per entry would make the
//! author write its geometry twice:
//!
//! ```text
//! shapes: [
//!     (kind: "rect", at: [16.0, 8.0], size: [24.0, 16.0], solid: true),
//!     (kind: "circle", at: [16.0, 2.0], radius: 6.0, occludes: true),
//!     (kind: "poly", at: [0.0, 0.0], points: [[0.0, 0.0], [12.0, 4.0], [2.0, 14.0]], occludes: true),
//!     // one wall, both jobs: bouncy, and it throws a shadow
//!     (kind: "rect", at: [16.0, 30.0], size: [32.0, 8.0], solid: (bounce: 0.2), occludes: true),
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! `kind` is `rect` (needs `size: [w, h]`, full pixels), `circle` (needs
//! `radius`) or `poly` (needs `points`, an array of `[x, y]` corners);
//! `capsule` is written into the grammar but refused for now, by name,
//! because there is no capsule shape anywhere to make of it. `solid` is
//! `true` or `(bounce: <number>)`, and a polygon is honoured as an
//! occluder only — pushing two polygons apart needs a separating axis and
//! a contact normal worth the name, which is a step of its own.
//!
//! The read serves two consumers, so it has two arms:
//! [`read_shapes`] hands back what the author drew, in the texture's own
//! pixels, plus every error — the arm a drawing tool uses, drawing every
//! entry whose geometry it could read while the errors speak beside it
//! (`sprite_util` overlays the shapes over the sprite exactly this way).
//! [`authored_shapes`] is the arm a [`Baker`](crate::Baker) feeds: the
//! same single pass, but all-or-nothing — one defect is the whole
//! document refused — and its entries stand in the node's space, every
//! role of an entry a [`Feature`] of its own.
//!
//! This is a vocabulary for a document designed for additions. The
//! sidecar round-trips through `sprite_util` with its comments and its
//! unknown keys intact — the tool interprets `atlas` and two-number
//! structs and preserves everything else — so `shapes:` joins `flower_anchors`
//! and friends as just another key the tool will not touch, and the next
//! key can arrive the same way. Two rules get rediscovered expensively
//! otherwise, so they are stated here where the reader can also enforce
//! them:
//!
//! * **Positions are arrays.** `at: [16.0, 8.0]`, never `at: (16.0, 8.0)`:
//!   `sprite_util` reads any struct with exactly two numeric fields as a
//!   draggable position spot, so a tuple is a handle the tool lets you
//!   grab and a shape whose numbers move under the author's hands. The
//!   reader refuses a tuple with exactly this explanation.
//! * **Errors are returned, never logged.** The sidecar's standing policy
//!   — an unparseable file: the sprite simply loads — is right for an
//!   atlas grid and wrong for hit boxes: a sprite that silently loads with
//!   no collision is a bug nobody can see by playing. Both arms hand the
//!   caller every error it found, all of them in one pass, and the caller
//!   decides whether the sprite loads; the reader never logs-and-continues.
//!
//! Authored numbers are in the texture's pixels: x right, y *down*, origin
//! at the image's top-left. The engine's footprints stand centred on the
//! node in user space, which is y-*up*, one unit per pixel — so the flip
//! happens here, in [`pixel_to_node`] and nowhere else, the way
//! `docs/authored-shapes.md` records it must. An authored shape that
//! reaches a baker takes the flip once, on its way out of this module;
//! an authored shape that reaches the author's eyes never takes it at
//! all. A polygon is convex or refused: [`Convex::new`] rejects a concave
//! or self-crossing outline, and this reader passes that refusal straight
//! through as its own message — nothing is decomposed, and nothing is
//! quietly hulled. Convexity survives a reflection, so it is decided in
//! the pixels it was authored in, before the flip — a drawing tool and a
//! baker must agree on which outlines are the same outline.

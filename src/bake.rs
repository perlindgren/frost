//! Authored geometry, baked into what the engine can actually use.
//!
//! A sprite's body, a tile's solid top, a character's hurt box are authored
//! facts about artwork: they live beside the sheet they describe, in the
//! sprite's or tile's own space, and they are written once and read by
//! thousands of instances. This module is where authored data turns into
//! engine shapes. [`Baker`] takes [`Feature`]s, each placed somewhere in a
//! node's space, and [`finish`](Baker::finish)es them into [`Baked`]: the flat
//! lists a frame and a movement step want.
//!
//! Everything stays in **the node's own space**, in and out. A baked set
//! travels with the node's [`Transform`](crate::Transform), which is what lets
//! one bake serve every instance, and it is why a stretched, turned sprite
//! still throws a shadow with square corners: nothing is ever baked into world
//! coordinates, so nothing has to approximate a sheared box.
//!
//! Three roles, three policies, because three consumers want different things
//! from the same authored shape:
//!
//! * [`Role::Occlude`] feeds the occluder field. The GPU reads one record per
//!   shape and tests every lit pixel against every record, so a floor of four
//!   thousand solid tiles is four thousand shadow tests per pixel per light.
//!   Boxes that span the same distance across and touch or overlap along the
//!   other axis are therefore fused into strips, and strips into blocks: the
//!   same covered points, far fewer records. Fusing also retires the shared
//!   edge, which is the one seam a light ray can slip along.
//! * [`Role::Solid`] feeds movement, where fusing is worth having for the same
//!   reason — but only within one [`Material`], because a crate and a
//!   trampoline that happen to touch must not become one wall that bounces.
//! * [`Role::Hit`] feeds the game's own logic: which hurt box was struck,
//!   which tile was clicked. Fusing them would answer the question with the
//!   wrong box, so hits come through exactly as authored.
//!
//! Only rectangles fuse: a fusion is taken when the result is still one
//! rectangle covering exactly the points the parts covered, which an L or a
//! circle never is. Nothing is dropped quietly either. A shape the bake cannot
//! honour — a box with no width, or a corner that is not a number — comes back
//! from [`Baker::add`] as a [`Rejection`] the loader can name, instead of
//! vanishing into a list that looks fine. A painted sprite that silently cannot
//! cast a shadow is the failure this path exists to end.
//!
//! An occluding *circle* is no longer among the refusals, and it is not
//! flattened on the way in either: the bake keeps it round and the
//! tessellation happens at the border, in [`Baked::declare_occluders`], where
//! the circle becomes the sixteen-gon the light field speaks. The authored
//! description outlives the bake, so the CPU is asked about the circle that was
//! drawn while the GPU is given the edges it can hold — the same arrangement
//! that lets a fused box keep its own turn until the transform carries it.
//!
//! Not here yet: capsules, the sidecar reader that would
//! build these features from a `.ron`, and a tile-grid broadphase for line
//! queries over very large maps — fused strips keep a linear scan cheap enough
//! until a real map says otherwise.

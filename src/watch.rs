//! Watching a file for change: the ladder's shared sense.
//!
//! Every hot tier climbs the same rung-shape — notice, re-read, swap
//! in — and noticing is this module's whole job: remember a file's
//! stamp, and answer `changed()` truthfully whenever it differs.
//! Polling metadata is a deliberate modesty: one `stat` per watched
//! file per frame costs microseconds, carries no OS event machinery,
//! and works identically for data, textures, maps, and shaders — the
//! tiers differ in what they re-read, never in how they notice.
//!
//! A file that does not exist is watched like one that does:
//! appearing is a change, and so is vanishing — a loose development
//! file removed beside a shipped binary tells the app to fall back
//! to what the binary carries. On targets without a filesystem every
//! answer is `false`: a shipped world does not change under itself.

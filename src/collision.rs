//! 2D collision math: shapes, overlap tests, and push-out resolution.
//!
//! Pure math — no winit, no wgpu, no state — so it is unit-tested without a
//! GPU and compiles identically for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Coordinates
//! are the same window-centered, y-up space the rest of frost draws in: x to
//! the right, y up, angles counter-clockwise in radians.
//!
//! This module answers questions; it owns no world and does no integration.
//! The game's [`Process`](crate::Process) keeps the positions and
//! velocities, builds a [`Collider`] from that state each frame, applies
//! [`Collider::push_out`] together with [`reflect`], and writes the new
//! position back into the scene node's transform.
//!
//! Segments are asked the same way, with no more state: [`Collider::cast`]
//! says where a segment first enters a shape, and the two policies built on
//! it differ only in what they do when an endpoint is inside a shape —
//! [`occluded`] is the CPU twin of the shaders' `occluded`, where a receiver
//! inside an occluder is lit rather than blocked, while [`visible`] answers
//! line of sight, where a shape containing either endpoint blocks.
//!
//! When a game outgrows this — stacking, joints, ragdolls, dozens of
//! mutually dynamic bodies that need a broadphase, or continuous collision
//! for very fast projectiles — the replacement is `rapier2d`: move the state
//! into its rigid bodies and swap these two call sites; the scene bridge and
//! the rendering stay the same.

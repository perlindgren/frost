//! A small, dependency-free random number generator.
//!
//! [`Rng`] is a splitmix64 generator: pure 64-bit integer arithmetic, so it
//! runs identically on every target — native or `wasm32` — with no seeding
//! system calls and no `rand` crate in the dependency tree. It is meant
//! for game-time randomness — spawn points, velocities, lifetimes — where a
//! full-featured distribution library is overkill.
//!
//! Seed from the clock with [`Rng::new`] for a different stream on each
//! run, or fix the stream with [`Rng::with_seed`] for reproducible
//! simulations and tests.

//! Reusable immediate-mode widgets: a [`Ui`] that draws [`button`](Ui::button),
//! [`checkbox`](Ui::checkbox), [`slider`](Ui::slider), [`label`](Ui::label)
//! and draggable [`panel`](Ui::panel) chrome straight onto the frame's
//! [`Canvas`], over whatever the game draws.
//!
//! The style follows the frame flow: declare your widgets every frame from
//! [`Process::process`](crate::Process::process), exactly like the immediate
//! canvas methods. The `Ui` keeps only the interaction state the immediate
//! style cannot re-derive: which widget holds the mouse, where each panel
//! has been dragged to, and how tall each panel's content grew.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # struct Demo { ui: frost::Ui, volume: f32, sound: bool }
//! # impl frost::Process for Demo {
//! fn process(&mut self, ctx: &mut frost::Context, _dt: f32) {
//!     self.ui.begin(ctx);
//!     self.ui.panel(ctx, "Settings", [-300.0, 150.0], 260.0, |ui, ctx| {
//!         ui.slider(ctx, "Volume", &mut self.volume, 0.0, 1.0);
//!         ui.checkbox(ctx, "Sound on", &mut self.sound);
//!         if ui.button(ctx, "Reset") {
//!             self.volume = 0.5;
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! **The input model.** Every widget hit-tests with the rects it registered
//! *last* frame, so press, drag and release resolve against stable geometry
//! even while a panel is moving under the cursor, and when two widgets
//! overlap the one declared last (drawn on top) wins the press. The cost is
//! one frame of latency on the press: a press that lands on a widget arms
//! the drag on the next frame, at 60 Hz an imperceptible 16 ms.
//!
//! **Identity.** Widget ids are hashed from the widget's label and the id
//! scope of the panel it is declared in, so the same label in two panels is
//! two widgets — but the same label *twice in one panel* is one widget hit
//! twice; give interactive widgets distinct labels.
//!
//! **Order.** Every draw the `Ui` records gets a `z` counting up from
//! [`UiStyle::base_z`] in declaration order, so the UI paints over the
//! scene (whose nodes default to `z = 0.0`) and panels stack in the order
//! they are declared.

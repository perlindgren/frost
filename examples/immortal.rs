//! A watering can and a spray can as mouse cursors over a full-screen
//! grass field. The window opens at `WINDOW` pixels (1920x1080), set
//! through `run_configured` and `Config::window_size`;
//! `assets/sprites/grass.png` is exactly that size, so it fills the window
//! without being stretched, and is re-stretched every frame to keep it
//! covered if the window is resized.
//!
//! Pressing and releasing the right mouse button toggles between the two
//! tools (both through [`frost::Context::mouse_button_down`]):
//!
//! - The watering can, `assets/sprites/water_can_outline.png`, follows
//!   the pointer: the sprite is cropped to the can, so the demo scales it
//!   `CAN_SIZE` pixels wide and its node — the texture's center — lands on
//!   the cursor. Holding the left mouse button down turns the can a
//!   quarter turn counter-clockwise around the pointer over
//!   `ROTATE_TIME` seconds; at the full tilt, water pours out of the spout
//!   as blue drops, and releasing turns the can back the same way.
//!
//! - The spray can is drawn at its natural size, with the pivot
//!   (`SPRAY_PIVOT`, in image pixels) on the cursor and the at-rest frame
//!   `assets/sprites/Spray1.png`. A fresh press of the left mouse button —
//!   one after a release; holding or re-pressing mid-burst does nothing —
//!   triggers a burst: over `BURST_TIME` seconds the can tweens a 45
//!   degree clockwise turn and back while showing the pressed frame
//!   (`assets/sprites/Spray2.png`), and during the first half — the
//!   clockwise tilting — it emits a green spray from the nozzle
//!   (`SPRAY_NOZZLE`, in image pixels).
//!
//! The cursor position comes from [`frost::Context::mouse_position`]. Run
//! with:
//!
//! ```text
